<p> Hi guys it me tyjameslund games aka the FoxKing! 
This is my second website that ive made, sadly my other website was hacked and deleted. I have many things to add to this
website but first of all I have to giev a shout out to a really fun PVP/Roleplay server Firestars haven and the IP is mc.firestarshaven.com.
I suggest joining this server because the staf are really nice and fair and so is everyone else. I know that because I have been on this server for
around 3 years. Second of all Im sorry I havent been uploading so much but I promise I will be uploading a lot more now. I also might get a rank
in hypixel, probly MVP+ and do more videos there to. Me and some of my friends are gonna make a minecraft server that is gonna be open
to the public and is gonna have a lot of games and challenges. The best thing is that you dont need to pay for the ranks with
real money, you just get tons of kills and rank up. There will also be the first rank give away when 5 peopel are on (not including staff). </p>
